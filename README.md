# Better Future

We all wish for a better future -- self-driving cars, fusion power, and UBI.
This repository does not provide any of this. Instead, it has a collection of
utilities that may make working with [futures-rs](http://github.com/alexcrichton/futures-rs)
easier.

## Contents

* `futures-test`: Utilities for testing future based code.
* `futures-watch`: A cell that notifies on update.
